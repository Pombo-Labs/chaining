Our Mission
For many parents of children with autism, accessing effective, evidence-based programs like Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is prohibitively expensive and logistically challenging. Pombo Labs was created to bridge that gap.

We translate proven clinical strategies into simple, free, and accessible digital tools that parents can use at home. Our goal is to empower parents with the resources they need to teach their children critical life skills, foster independence, and build a more confident and joyful life together.

About the Project: The "Chain Builder"
This repository contains the source code for our first flagship tool: the Chain Builder.

Chaining is a powerful behavioral strategy used to teach complex skills by breaking them down into a sequence of smaller, manageable steps. For example, a skill like "Washing Hands" can be broken down into 10-12 individual actions.

The Chain Builder helps parents create, manage, and track these skill chains for their children. It provides a structured, visual, and data-driven way to teach multi-step tasks, turning what can be an overwhelming process into a clear, step-by-step journey. The tool is designed to support the two primary methods of chaining:

Forward Chaining: Teaching the first step of the chain until it's mastered, then the second, and so on.

Backward Chaining: Teaching the last step of the chain first. This is highly motivating as the child always gets to complete the task and immediately experience the successful outcome.

Key Features
üìö Task Analysis Library: Start with pre-built templates for common daily routines like "Brushing Teeth," "Getting Dressed," and "Setting the Table."

‚úèÔ∏è Fully Customizable Chains: Edit, reorder, or delete steps in any template. Add your own photos or icons to make each step visually clear and personalized for your child. Create entirely new chains from scratch for any skill you want to teach.

üöÄ Live Training Module: An "in-the-moment" interface for teaching. As you guide your child through the skill, you can quickly mark each step as Independent (‚òÖ) or Prompted (ü§ù). The tool automatically highlights the target step based on the chaining method you've chosen.

üìä Visual Progress Dashboard: See your child's progress at a glance. The tool visualizes which steps are mastered, which are in progress, and which are yet to be taught. Simple charts and encouraging feedback help you stay motivated and celebrate every success.
